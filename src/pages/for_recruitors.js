                    For conducting pre-placement lectures and analytical
                    examinations, the institute features a well-equipped
                    auditorium, computer centre and smart classrooms.
                    The institute guest house constitutes conference
                    rooms as well as provisions for Group Discussions and
                    Personal Interviews. Student Placement Coordinators
                    endeavour towards a smooth placement season.
                    Facilities video conferencing are available for
                    conducting one-to-one interviews. The old Student
                    Activity Centre (SAC), presently known as Dr. S.
                    Radhakrishna Auditorium, equipped with an advanced
                    JBL Hi-Tech Surround Sound System, can
                    accommodate around 800 individuals. It has been a
                    witness to many splendid performances over the
                    years, by eminent artists. The computer centre
                    ceaselessly offers sustained services with continuous
                    power supply to on-campus students, thereby

                    department is notably taking the initiative of switching

                    Packet Switches. Simultaneous examinations and
                    online tests can efficiently be conducted in the
